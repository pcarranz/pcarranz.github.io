                  I got started with FIRST Robotics during my junior year of high school. I had a friend,
                  who was already involved, tell me about it and how awesome it was so I decided to enroll
                  in my school's zero-period robotics class.
               </p>
               <p>
                  It was a bit difficult getting up in the morning to be in class by 7am, but the program
                  was completely worth it. I learned about electronics and electrical wiring and got my
                  start building static web pages in HTML and CSS. I also got to meet and interact with awesome
                  engineers from Walt Disney Imagineering when they visited our school for mentoring sessions.
                  Once competition season came around the entire team worked endless hours
                  before and after school to have our robot competition ready. I was fortunate enough to be
                  part of the travelling team and got to experience visits to Denver, Atlanta, and Phoenix.

                  FRC competitions are intense-- a great mixture of excitement, nervousness, drive, focus, and
                  communication. During my senior year, I was one of two females on the drive-team. It was the first
                  time the team had two female drivers. I felt proud participating as the drive team captain and taking
                  part in representing my team on stage to select our final alliances.The experience was exhilarating
                  and 2009 marked the year the team obtained their first Blue Banner (Los Angeles Regional Winners).

                  Attending the FRC Championships was also an enlightening and inspirational experience. It was impressive
                  to see the global reach the competition has. Speeches by Dean Kamen also stood out to me and provided
                  insight into just how great everyone's accomplishments are. Ever since graduating from high school I
                  have tried to keep active in some way with FIRST. I have volunteered at Cal Poly Vex Robotics events and
                  with a high school in Atascadero (FRC Team 973).
